Welcome to the JSI Jobs Web API!

The web API allows the user to query for Data Science Jobs, that have been found using the
Adzuna API and were stored using the QMiner data analytics platform. It contains only the
Job Posts containing the Data Science (predefined) skillset that were published in the EU.

    countries: ['Denmark', 'United Kingdom'], // array of countries
    locations: ['London', 'Berlin']           // array of locations/cities
}

or in url:
